# map_filter_lambdas_assignment

I changed code in last question to have different output. I initially had 0 has value for 0th term in fib sequence and then 1 for the 1st and 2nd term.
Changed base case values so the 0th and 1st terms(or iterations) returned value of 0 and matched the intended output. Also added function within the function to print
desired output with for loop.
